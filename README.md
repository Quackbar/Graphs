# Graphs
Programming Assignment Number 3 for CSCI 232
So this Project was made in netbeans so in order to run it you will have to open it in NetBeans.
Just run the Graphs.java to run each different algorithm.
We also dont generally use github we use gitlab which is why there isnt any commit history but we are uploading a screencapture from gitkracken showing the commit history of 
our whole project.
