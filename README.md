Programming Assignment Number 3 for CSCI 232
So this Project was made in netbeans so in order to run it you will have to open it in NetBeans.
For each seperate part of the assignment there is a java file named after the method used within so simply run each file seperately to see the output.
We also dont generally use github we use gitlab which is why there isnt any commit history but we are uploading a screencapture from gitkracken showing the commit history of 
our whole project.
